              Many bartenders teach themselves to mix drinks, or learn on the
              job. Aspiring bartenders have the option of going to bartending
              school to obtain a state-issued license, but few states require
              certification and drink standards vary from bar to bar. The best
              way to become a bartender is through experience. Bartender Kenji
              Magrann-Wells previously told Business Insider that new bartenders
              must get experience before getting into large venues. Many
              bartenders start as waiters or bartending assistants before
              getting a gig themselves. "Experience is key, especially when
              going for the giant mega-clubs where the atmosphere is tense and
              the payout is ridiculous," Magrann-Well said. "So take the jobs
              where you can get them."
